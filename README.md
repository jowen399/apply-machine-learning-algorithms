# Applying-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This project applies various machine learning algorithms to data from the video game 'Fifa 19'

#### Description:
This project was completed during my studies for my 'Postgraduate certificate in Applied Data Science' course. It applies various machine learning algorithms to make predicitons on data from the video game 'Fifa 19'.

#### Contents:
The executable ipynb file, which processes the raw data and simulates results, including comments describing the process
The raw data (in the form of a CSV)

#### Installation:
To run the file inpynb, the CSV will need to be saved locally or uploaded into google colab. The existing file name must be retained.
When using the Anaconda distribution package, no pip installs are required, however, this may be required if using a different platform to run the code.
